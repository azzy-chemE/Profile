## About

I'm a beginner coder who is very new to HTML, CSS, and JS! This is my first personal website, designed to showcase who I am and what I do. It's currently a work-in-progress, and I try my best to add updates to the website that are dynamic and engaging. The site will eventually display my projects, skills, and experiences through an interactive layout, serving as a way to enrich my résumé. Some cool features include an animated header, transition, and background. You can also download my resume.

The goal of this small project is to present my work and my identity as a software developer in a visually interesting way, as I'm creative by nature. You'll see me experiment through several different styles and layouts here. Hopefully, my website will eventually be intuitive, easy to navigate, and a place where you can understand where my passion in engineering and coding truly lies. 

## Functionality & launch

Open the website on: https://azzy-cheme.github.io/Profile/

Use the sidebar to navigate between different sections of my site. 

On the "Resume" tab, click on the hyperlink to open my resume in a new tab and download it.

# Azzy's profile 

This is my profile website, designed to showcase who I am and what I do. I try my best to add updates to the website that are dynamic and engaging. The site displays my projects, skills, and experiences through an interactive layout, serving as a way to enrich my résumé.

The goal of this small project is to present my work and my identity as a software developer in a visually interesting way, as I'm creative by nature. However, I'm also a beginner when it comes to advanced front-end animation and layouts, so you'll see me experiment through several different styles and layouts here. Hopefully, you'll find my website intuitive, easy to navigate, and a place where you can understand where my passion in engineering and coding truly lies.
